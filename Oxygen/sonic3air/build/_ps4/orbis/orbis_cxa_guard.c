 *
 * __cxa_guard_acquire / __cxa_guard_release / __cxa_guard_abort - the C++ runtime's
 * function-local-static guards, replacing libc++abi's on this platform.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A CORRECTION, NOT A HACK, AND THE NEXT PERSON TO FIND A HAND-WRITTEN
 * __cxa_guard_acquire IN A GAME CONSOLE PORT IS RIGHT TO BE SUSPICIOUS. So: the measurement.
 *
 * melondsds aborted on hardware 6.5 seconds into loading content, with
 *
 *     [orbis] libc++abi: __cxa_guard_acquire detected recursive initialization
 *
 * and there is no recursive initialization. Nothing in that module initialises a
 * function-local static from its own initializer: all 34 guard variables were enumerated and
 * all 39 acquire sites mapped to their guards, and a whole-module call graph (16410 functions,
 * 23460 direct-call edges) has exactly one guard-owning function reachable from itself - and
 * only along the abort path, which is unreachable in normal execution. The message is a FALSE
 * POSITIVE, and this is how it is produced.
 *
 * libc++abi detects recursion by storing the initialising thread's id in the guard and
 * comparing it against the caller's. In melondsds.elf:
 *
 *     9eba0:  cmpl  $0x0, %edx                       ; init byte PENDING - someone is running it
 *     9ebbd:  callq LazyValue<PlatformThreadID>::get()
 *     9ebd2:  cmpl  (%rcx), %eax                     ; that thread's id == mine ?
 *     9ebe3:  callq abort_message                    ; -> "detected recursive initialization"
 *
 * and PlatformThreadID, in full:
 *
 *     000000000009eae0 <__cxxabiv1::(anonymous namespace)::PlatformThreadID()>:
 *       9eae4:  movl  $0x14, %edi                    ; syscall 20
 *       9eaeb:  callq syscall
 *       9eaf1:  retq
 *
 * Syscall 20 is getpid, because the SDK's own headers say so:
 *
 *     openorbis/include/bits/syscall.h:18    #define __NR_getpid  20
 *     openorbis/include/bits/syscall.h:410   #define __NR_gettid  __NR_getpid
 *     openorbis/include/bits/syscall.h:827   #define SYS_gettid   __NR_getpid
 *
 * This kernel has no gettid, so musl's headers alias it to getpid - a reasonable thing for a
 * header to do, and a disaster for the one caller that wanted the two to differ. libc++abi's
 * cxa_guard_impl.h takes its `#if defined(SYS_gettid)` arm, believes the platform has thread
 * ids, and gets THE PROCESS ID - the same value on every thread. So "the thread initialising
 * this static is me" is true for ANY two threads, and the first time two of them race on the
 * same function-local static - the ordinary case guard variables exist to serialise - the
 * second one aborts instead of waiting.
 *
 * ⚠ AND FIXING THE SDK HEADER WOULD NOT HELP, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS.
 * libc++.a is shipped PREBUILT. `#define SYS_gettid __NR_getpid` was read when Sony's libc++
 * was compiled and the syscall number is baked into cxa_guard.cpp.o; deleting the line today
 * changes nothing until somebody rebuilds libc++ from source. Overriding the three entry
 * points is the only fix available from this repository.
 *
 * ⚠ SO IT IS CAUGHT BY DEFINITION ORDER, exactly as ps4/orbis_abort_report.c catches abort()
 * and __assert_fail - read that file for the mechanism in full. The precondition it warns
 * about ("overriding a symbol whose member defined anything else would be a different and much
 * worse idea") was checked before this was written:
 *
 *     libc++.a(cxa_guard.cpp.o):  T __cxa_guard_acquire  T __cxa_guard_release
 *                                 T __cxa_guard_abort    ... and nothing else strong
 *
 * Three strong symbols, all three defined here, so that member is never pulled and there is no
 * duplicate. The core support archive and the frontend's own object list both sit ahead of
 * -lc++ on their link lines.
 *
 * ⚠ ONLY THE IDENTITY IS CHANGED. THE LOCKING IS libc++abi's, DELIBERATELY.
 *
 * The synchronisation below - one process-wide statically-initialised mutex and condition
 * variable - is the same shape as libc++abi's InitByteGlobalMutex, and that is a decision
 * rather than an accident: the failing run proves those primitives WORK here. The abort came
 * from inside libc++abi's own LockGuard, so a statically zero-initialised pthread_mutex_t was
 * locked successfully on this kernel before the wrong comparison was reached. Replacing the
 * one broken part and keeping every part that is known to work is the smallest change that
 * fixes it; a lock-free rewrite would be a second, unmeasured thing to be wrong about.
 *
 * ⚠ THE THREAD IDENTITY IS %fs:0, AND IT IS THE ONE CANDIDATE THAT IS PROVEN ON HARDWARE.
 *
 * That is the musl TCB self-pointer: on x86-64 the thread pointer lives in %fs, and the first
 * word of the thread control block points at the block itself, so one instruction yields an
 * address that is different for every thread by construction.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS NOT AN ASSUMPTION HERE - IT IS IN THE FAILING RUN'S OWN EVIDENCE. This module's
 * stdio does exactly this, on every character:
 *
 *     000000000008acd4 <__lockfile>:
 *       8acdf:  movq  %fs:0x0, %rcx        ; the TCB
 *       8ace8:  movl  0x38(%rcx), %edx     ; ...this thread's id inside it
 *
 * and /data/retroarch-abort.log exists on the console, written by fputs through that very
 * function. If %fs:0 read the same on every thread, __lockfile's owner check would be broken
 * and stdio would have been corrupting itself process-wide long before this. The console
 * wrote the file, so %fs:0 is a real per-thread pointer here.
 *
 * The alternatives were all worse:
 *
 *   - syscall(SYS_gettid) is the bug.
 *   - pthread_self() is an UNRESOLVED IMPORT here (`U pthread_self` in the module, defined in
 *     none of libc.a, libkernel.a or libc++.a - the console's PRX supplies it at load). It is
 *     probably fine. "Probably fine" about a thread identity is what caused this, and it costs
 *     an import in every core that links this file.
 *   - The address of a __thread byte of our own is distinct per thread too, but it compiles to
 *     general-dynamic TLS - `U __tls_get_addr` - and that goes THROUGH %fs:0 anyway to reach
 *     the DTV at 0x8(%rax), so it assumes everything below plus a working DTV, and adds a call
 *     into libc from inside the C++ runtime's own bootstrap. Strictly more to be wrong about
 *     for the same answer. (Measured: no object in melondsds references __tls_get_addr, so
 *     that path is not exercised by any core today and would be new ground.)
 *
 * ⚠ AND IF IT EVER READS 0 IT IS TREATED AS "NO IDENTITY" rather than as a match - see
 * owner_is_self. A thread that somehow reached a static initializer without a TCB loses
 * recursion detection and waits, which is the safe direction.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS C, NOT C++, FOR THE SAME REASON. A function-local static anywhere in this
 * translation unit would compile into a call to the function below it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHERE THE DETECTION DEGRADES, IT DEGRADES TOWARDS WAITING. If the owner table is full, or
 * the thread anchor reads as 0, the recursion check is skipped and the caller waits. A missed
 * detection turns a genuine recursive initializer - a real C++ bug, and a rare one - into a
 * hang. A false detection kills a working core. Those are not equally bad, and the fallback
 * picks the survivable one; it is also what libc++abi itself does on a platform with no thread
 * id at all, where PlatformThreadID is a null pointer and the check is compiled out.

/* ⚠ BYTE 0 IS THE ABI, AND THE REST OF THE GUARD IS OURS.
 *
 * The Itanium C++ ABI guard is 8 bytes (llvm-nm confirms: every _ZGV* in the module has size
 * 8), and the compiler inlines a fast path that reads THE FIRST BYTE and skips the call
 * entirely when it is non-zero. From anchorPath in melondsds.elf:
 *
 *     80e6d:  movzbl 0x4e3674(%rip), %eax   # _ZGVZN5orbis10anchorRootEvE4root
 *     80e74:  testb  %al, %al
 *     80e76:  je     <slow path: call __cxa_guard_acquire>
 *
 * So byte 0 must become non-zero exactly when initialization is complete, and it must be
 * published with release ordering because that reader does not take our mutex. Byte 1 is
 * private to this file; bytes 2-7 are left alone. Nothing here needs to match libc++abi's
 * layout - a guard is only ever handled by the implementation that claimed it, and the three
 * entry points are replaced together. */
