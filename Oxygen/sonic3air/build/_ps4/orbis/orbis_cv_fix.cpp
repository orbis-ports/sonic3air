/* std::condition_variable, rebuilt against this platform's errno values.
 *
 * ⚠ THE BUG IS IN THE TOOLCHAIN'S PREBUILT libc++.a, NOT IN ANY CORE. Measured on hardware
 * 2026-08-25, mupen64plus-next loading a ROM:
 *
 *     [orbis] libc++abi: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error:
 *             condition_variable timed_wait failed: Operation timed out
 *
 * "Operation timed out" IS errno 60, ETIMEDOUT, and a timeout is the ordinary outcome of a timed
 * wait - wait_for is supposed to return cv_status::timeout, not throw. It threw because the
 * comparison that filters that case out was compiled against a different number. Disassembling
 * condition_variable.cpp.o from libc++.a:
 *
 *     322: 83 7d 94 6e    cmpl $0x6e, -0x6c(%rbp)     ; 0x6e = 110
 *
 * 110 is Linux's ETIMEDOUT. This console is FreeBSD underneath and its pthread returns 60, which
 * the SDK's own bits/errno.h agrees with. So libc++ was built against Linux errno values and
 * shipped to a FreeBSD target, and `ec != ETIMEDOUT` is true for every timeout there has ever
 * been on this platform.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS NOT LIMITED TO condition_variable. std::future::wait_for,
 * shared_timed_mutex and everything else that waits with a deadline goes through
 * __do_timed_wait, so on this console a C++ core that waits on anything with a timeout dies the
 * first time the timeout expires. That is a normal thing for a worker queue to do while a ROM is
 * being parsed and nothing is being submitted yet.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY NOT FIX IT AT pthread_cond_timedwait INSTEAD, which would be one function rather than
 * four. Because the two callers disagree and translating breaks the honest one: everything
 * compiled in this workshop sees ETIMEDOUT as 60 through the SDK's headers and tests for 60,
 * while only the prebuilt library expects 110. Rewriting the return value to 110 would fix
 * libc++ by breaking every direct caller. The mismatch belongs where it was introduced.
 *
 * ⚠ SO ALL FIVE STRONG SYMBOLS OF THE MEMBER HAVE TO BE HERE, not just the broken one.
 * condition_variable.cpp.o defines notify_one, notify_all, wait, __do_timed_wait and
 * notify_all_at_thread_exit, and an archive member is all-or-nothing: providing our own
 * __do_timed_wait means the member is never pulled and the other four would go undefined. They
 * are reproduced from libc++ 11's own source (_LIBCPP_VERSION 11000, which is what this SDK
 * ships) so the only thing that differs is the constant. notify_all_at_thread_exit is the
 * exception and is deliberately absent - it needs libc++'s private per-thread bookkeeping, and
 * no core here has ever referenced it. If one does, the link says so by name.
 *
 * The real fix is a libc++ rebuilt against the target's headers, which is an OpenOrbis SDK
 * change rather than ours.
