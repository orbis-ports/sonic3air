/* The message a core prints on its way to abort(), on a console where stderr goes nowhere.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX DOES NOT WORK.
 *
 * assert(), libc++abi's abort_message() and __cxa_pure_virtual all say exactly what went wrong
 * and then call abort(). Every one of those messages goes to stderr, and on this kernel fd 2
 * goes nowhere. What reaches the log is a fatal signal with SIGABRT in %rsi and a backtrace
 * that stops at abort() - a crash with its own explanation discarded.
 *
 * The obvious fix is to point fd 2 somewhere. It is not available: dup2 onto 1 or 2 returns
 * EPERM on this kernel (measured 2026-08-25, frontend_orbis_capture_stderr). The descriptor
 * table is not ours to rearrange, so the message has to be caught before it is written rather
 * than after.
 *
 * ⚠ SO IT IS CAUGHT BY DEFINITION ORDER, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH UNDERSTANDING. Both
 * abort_message and __assert_fail live in archive members of their own - abort_message.cpp.o in
 * libc++.a, assert.lo in libc.a - and each member defines that one symbol and nothing else. An
 * archive member is pulled only for a symbol still undefined, so a definition that reaches the
 * linker FIRST means the toolchain's member is never pulled and there is no duplicate. The core
 * support archive is on the link line ahead of -lc and -lc++, which is what makes this work; see
 * ps4/build-cores.sh. Overriding a symbol whose member defined anything else would be a
 * different and much worse idea.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT REPORTS THROUGH klog, NOT THE NICE CHANNEL. sceKernelDebugOutText is synchronous -
 * it has returned by the time the call returns - while a UDP datagram needs the process to live
 * long enough for the network stack to send it, and this process is three instructions from
 * abort(). The same argument orbis-compat's ps4_log_fatal makes, for the same reason. The file
 * is written second, because it is the copy that can be read later at leisure.

    * ⚠ AND GUARDED, BECAUSE THE FILE COPY IS THE ONLY PART OF THIS THAT CAN COME BACK HERE.
    * fopen reaches orbis-compat's interposed open(), which calls anchorPath(), which calls
    * anchorRoot() - a function-local static. Today that is a cycle on paper and not in practice:
    * anchorPath returns on the first character of an ABSOLUTE path, before it ever touches the
    * guard, and ORBIS_ABORT_LOG is absolute. From anchorPath in a linked core:
    *
    *     80e5e:  cmpl   $0x2f, %eax           ; '/'
    *     80e61:  je     0x80f39               ; ...returns here
    *     80e6d:  movzbl _ZGVZN5orbis10anchorRootEvE4root(%rip), %eax   ; guard, only after that
    *
    * So this is defence in depth against the day someone gives it a relative path or another
    * interposer grows a static of its own - and the day is worth guarding against, because the
    * consequence changed. It used to be a second abort message; with ps4/orbis_cxa_guard.c
    * answering the guards it would be a DEADLOCK, the process parked on a condition variable
    * waiting for an initializer that is itself waiting for this report to finish.
    *
    * klog above is deliberately outside the guard: sceKernelDebugOutText is a direct kernel call
    * that cannot re-enter anything here, so the message still gets out even when the file copy is
    * skipped. A global rather than a thread-local flag - two threads reporting at once lose one
    * FILE copy and keep both klog lines, and a thread-local in the abort path would be one more
    * thing that has to work while the process is dying. */

/* ⚠ AND THE ONE THAT MATTERS WHEN THE OTHER TWO ARE NEVER REACHED.
 *
 * Plenty of code calls abort() directly and says nothing first - libunwind's _LIBUNWIND_ABORT
 * writes to stderr and aborts without going near abort_message, GNU lightning aborts on an
 * unencodable instruction, paraLLEl-RSP's allocator aborts when its arena is exhausted. All of
 * those arrive as a bare SIGABRT with the module's abort() as the only frame, because a core is
 * built -fomit-frame-pointer and the console's backtracer cannot walk through it. mupen64plus-next
 * did exactly that twice before this existed.
 *
 * So the one thing this must produce is the RETURN ADDRESS - who called abort. That is on the
 * stack whether or not there is a frame pointer, which is what makes it available when a
 * backtrace is not.
 *
 * ⚠ AND A SECOND ADDRESS WITH IT, because the first is useless on its own: a module is loaded
 * wherever the kernel puts it, and nothing in the log says where. Printing the address of a
 * function from THIS file alongside it gives the reader both ends - subtract its known offset in
 * the .elf and the module base falls out, and with it the offset to symbolize.
 *
 * ⚠ musl's abort.lo ALSO DEFINES __abort_lock, so overriding abort() means that member is never
 * pulled and anything else referencing that symbol would fail to link. It is defined here for
 * that reason; if it ever collides, the collision is the loud kind and easy to unpick.
